## Getting Started

### Download the Repository
To download the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntonisZks/Data-Mining.git
```
Then navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd Data-Mining
```
Installing Packages and Dependencies
To run the project locally, you’ll need to install a few Python libraries. All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create and activate one as follows:
> ```bash
> python3 -m venv <venv-name>
> ```
> Activate the environment using the following commands
> - If you are on Windows run:
> ```bash
> venv\Scripts\activate
> ```
> - If you are on Linux or MacOS:
> ```bash
>  source venv/bin/activate
> ```
> Once the virtual environment is activated, install the requirements with:
> ```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
> Finally select the corresponding kernel and run the code.
